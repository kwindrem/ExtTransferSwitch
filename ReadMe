This software interfaces an external transfer switch ahead of a MultiPlus AC input

A GX device digital input is connected to the external transfer switch to indicate
	if the grid or generator is routed to the Multi's AC input
	This service then makes changed to the AC input current limit and AC source(type)
	grid/shore or generator

Two input types are reserved for a grid connection: grid or shore.
	This selection is stored so that that specific selection is restored when
	switching back from generator

In addition, the AC input current limit is saved when on both generator and grid
	so that value can also be restored.

Separate grid and generator input current limits are needed for a tidy transition
	between grid and generator.
	These are stored in dbus
		/Settings/TransferSwitch/GridCurrentLimit
		/Settings/TransferSwitch/GeneratorCurrentLimit

When the transfer switch is set to grid, ...GridCurrentLimit is updated when
	updating the AC input current limit through the normal mechanisms (various places in the GUI).
	Likewise, ...GeneratorCurrentLimit is updated when the transfer switch is set to generator.

A new digital input type "External transfer switch" allows the external transfer switch to
	communicate with the this software.
	This input should be connected to an isolated contact on the transfer switch that closes
	when the transfer switch is in the generator position.
	The logic can be inverted if the contact closes when on grid.
	The invert control is located in the device list under the transfer switch device

Setup:

The easiest way to install this or other of my packages is to first install SetupHelper,
then use its package install tool. Refer to the SetupHelper ReadMe for instructions.
